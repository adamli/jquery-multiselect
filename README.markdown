# jQuery MultiSelect Plugin & UI Widget

This plugin turns an ordinary HTML select control into elegant drop down list of checkboxes, stylable with ThemeRoller.  

**There are currently two versions being developed in this repository.**  The "plugin" branch (not actually a Git branch) is the original MultiSelect
plugin (requires only jQuery and a theme).  The "widget" branch is a rewrite of the plugin using the jQuery UI widget factory.  Both are actively maintained.
